> Under drought stress, TZEI 17, TZEI 3, TZEI 23, and TZEI 13 were the closest to the ideal genotype, while TZEI 7, TZEI 2, and TZEI 11 were the closest under low-N conditions.

> the check TZEQI 39 × TZEQI 44 were the highest yielding under each stress environment and across environments. Hybrid TZEQI 210 × TZEQI 188 was the most stable across environments and should be tested on-farm and commercialized in SSA.

> Additionally, two of the top six period 3 hybrids (TZEEI 29 × TZEEI 13) × TZEEI 64 and TZdEEI 64 × TZEEI 54 were found to be the best yielding and most stable across the 14 test environments and were highly recommended for extensive evaluations to warrant their commercialization in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)

> The maize synthetics and their varietal-cross hybrids, along with a drought-tolerant check (PVASYN13), were evaluated under MDS and well-watered (WW) conditions at Ikenne, Nigeria, for two years. 

> Three of the varietal-cross hybrids (PVASYNHGBC0/PVASYNHGAC0, PVASYNHGBC0/PVASYNHGAC1 and PVASYNHGBC1/PVASYNHGAC2) had significant mid-parent heterosis for grain yield under the two test conditions, and were recommended for developing drought-tolerant varieties to combat VAD in drought-prone environments of SSA.

Plan for the review


## Title: Genome-wide association in maize for low nitrogen and drought stress in Africa: status and prospects


### Introduction






### Section 1: Low nitrogen and drought stress effects on maize productivity in Africa

parlez des degats de ces deux facteurs sur la production du maize

faire un graphe pour la production de maize sur 10 ans montrer la chute ...quantifier les degats lies au low N2 and DS  etc....

Maize is one of the important and staple food in SS. 
Maize productivity is Africa is affected by two major abiotic stresses such are drought and low nitrogen. Drought is recorded as the first abiotic stress limiting maize productivity in Africa. It is followed by low nitrogen that is the second most important tress affecting maize in Africa. Between 2019 and 2021, the average maize grain yield in SSA was estimated at… compared with … in Mexico and … in United States as a result of drought and low fertilizer utilization by farmers know as low nitrogen stress
Drought and low nitrogen effects as a lot similar. When a plant is subject to these two stresses, its growth is reduced, the interval anthesis silking increases due to a delay silking, the kernel is reduced and in consequence the yield dropped. 

Due to the climate change and the inability to access to affordable fertilizer, farmer's suffer the effects of drought and low nitrogen. studies have also shown that drought will be the most limitting maize production in the future.

### Section 3: Functionnal validation of candidate genes relative to low and drought tpolerance in maize

Parler ici de l'aspect validation  des genes detectes au niveau du GWAS


> For well-studied traits, peaks detected by a new GWAS method can be compared with known associated genes or genomic regions for validation (Yang et al., 2018). New causal genes underlying GWAS peaks have been identified through transgenic and other approaches, including RNAi, mutant rescue, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene silencing, knockout, and overexpression (Li et al., 2017; Si et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Yano et al., 2016). In some exemplary cases, a single paper may perform both biological and statistical validation of GWAS methods (Liu et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018).
