## Title: Genome-wide association in maize for low nitrogen and drought stress in Africa: status and prospects


### Introduction






### Section 1: Low nitrogen and drought stress effects on maize productivity in Africa

parlez des degats de ces deux facteurs sur la production du maize

faire un graphe pour la production de maize sur 10 ans montrer la chute ...quantifier les degats lies au low N2 and DS  etc....

Maize is one of the important and staple food in SS. 
Maize productivity is Africa is affected by two major abiotic stresses such are drought and low nitrogen. Drought is recorded as the first abiotic stress limiting maize productivity in Africa. It is followed by low nitrogen that is the second most important tress affecting maize in Africa. Between 2019 and 2021, the average maize grain yield in SSA was estimated at… compared with … in Mexico and … in United States as a result of drought and low fertilizer utilization by farmers know as low nitrogen stress
Drought and low nitrogen effects as a lot similar. When a plant is subject to these two stresses, its growth is reduced, the interval anthesis silking increases due to a delay silking, the kernel is reduced and in consequence the yield dropped. 

Due to the climate change and the inability to access to affordable fertilizer, farmer's suffer the effects of drought and low nitrogen. studies have also shown that drought will be the most limitting maize production in the future






### Section 2: GWAS for low nitrogen and drought tolerant gene detection in maize

### Section 3: Functionnal validation of candidate genes relative to low and drought tpolerance in maize

Parler ici de l'aspect validation  des genes detectes au niveau du GWAS


> For well-studied traits, peaks detected by a new GWAS method can be compared with known associated genes or genomic regions for validation (Yang et al., 2018). New causal genes underlying GWAS peaks have been identified through transgenic and other approaches, including RNAi, mutant rescue, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene silencing, knockout, and overexpression (Li et al., 2017; Si et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2018; Yano et al., 2016). In some exemplary cases, a single paper may perform both biological and statistical validation of GWAS methods (Liu et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018).
